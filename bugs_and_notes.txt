First try to implement Oracle db functions, eg.
    fetching data to local table, formatting and managing etc.
Then work on core functionality like run_serial_loop

How run_serial_loop might work -
    run_serial_loop (
        task, task, task, some_condition_task(a, b)
    )

the some_condition_task fuction should return true / false based on which 
loop will run or stop 

Then, work on core arithmetic and string manipulation functionalities
